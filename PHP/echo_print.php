<?php

// there are two basic ways to get output: //! echo and print.

//? The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.


//* 1. Echo Statement :
// The echo statement can be used with or without parentheses: echo or echo().



//* 2. Print Statment : 
// The print statement can be used with or without parentheses: print or print().
